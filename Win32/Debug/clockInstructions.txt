There are 12 piles layed out in a circle with 4 cards
in the middle. 4 cards are dealt to the 12 outer piles
with a single card dealt to the 4 middle piles.

The card in the top left pile is turned over.

From this point onwards you click on the cards and then
they move next to the pile which will be the next to play
